# Rootul Patel

Hi, I'm currently a software engineer at [Celestia](https://celestia.org/).

Previously, I worked at AWS on [Amazon Managed Blockchain](https://aws.amazon.com/managed-blockchain/) (on [Ethereum](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/03/announcing-general-availability-of-ethereum-on-amazon-managed-blockchain/) and [Hyperledger Fabric v2.2](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/01/amazon-managed-blockchain-hyperledger-fabric-2-2/)).
Prior to that, I worked at Palantir on [Foundry](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/).

I enjoy plant-based food, crypto podcasts, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62871533-rootul-patel), and [travel](https://bit.ly/rootulp-map).
