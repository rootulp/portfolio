# Reading list

Prior to 2022 I didn't maintain this page but a partial list of my favorite reads are on [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/@cp8p4T62A36aod1542g5815g8ed7AX7a7dtzW8u6aoN1ejpfR1058Rk2yemnKa3b).
If you want to talk about any of these, please reach out to me!

- https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721
  - `tokenURI` points to ERC721 Metadata JSON schema which contains properties / image
  - `setApprovalForAll()` authorizes an operator to manage all of the tokens you have from this contract
  - `approve()` authorizes the approved address to manage an individual tokenId
- https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155
  - uses `URI` instead of `tokenURI` from ERC-721
  - enables batch transfers
  - enables one contract to support multiple collections of NFTs
  - enables one contract to support NFTs and SFTs (semi-fungible tokens)
- https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981
  - adds `royaltyInfo()` function that exchanges can opt-in to using in order to determine how much of a token sale should be distributed to creator
- https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165
  - adds `supportsInterface()` function that enables a contract to determine if another contract supports a particular interface
- https://blog.opensea.io/announcements/introducing-the-collection-manager/
  - Uses ERC-1155
  - Is [this](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963#readContract) collection manager on Polygon?
- https://research.paradigm.xyz/cartoon-guide-to-perps
  - perpetual swap == perp
  - mark price: price of perp on exchange
  - index price: price of underlying asset on external exchange
  - funding fee = abs(mark price - index price). Paid between ppl who long and short
  - margin: collateral a trader puts up
- https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/05/everlasting-options
  - > A call gives the holder the right to buy a certain asset (the underlier) for a certain price (the strike), at a certain time on a certain date (the expiration).
  - A put option is the right to sell an asset for a price at a certain time
  - call payoff = max(spot - strike, 0)
  - put payoff = max(strike - spot, 0)
  - [Black-Scholes model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model) is a curve used to price a call or put prior to expiry
  - options with a expiry date which forces traders who want to maintain their position after the expiry to "roll" (aquire new options with a later expiry)
  - since options have different expiry dates, market makers have fragmented liquidity b/c they need to faciliate markets for options that expire today, tomorrow, next week, etc.
- https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/08/power-perpetuals
  - funding fee = abs(mark - index). Paid between ppl who long and short at a regular interval (ex. daily).
  - funding fee == premium yield
  - > If the price of ETH doubles, the ETH^2 power perp 4Xs
- https://opyn.gitbook.io/squeeth/resources/squeeth-faq
  - basis == funding fee == abs(mark - index)
  - funding in-kind: ppl who long Squeeth (buy oSQTH) don't have to explicitly pay funding fee to ppl who short Squeeth per interval (daily).
    Instead, the normalization factor adjusts a long Squeeth position so it loses value equal to the funding fee per interval.
    Similarly, the normalization factor adjusts a short Squeeth position so it owes less debt equal to the funding fee per interval.
  - funding fee = position size * TWAP(mark - index)
  - funding fee is paid everytime contract is touched (continuously)

  - reminds me a lot of [Chrix Dixon on Bankless podcast](http://podcast.banklesshq.com/90-5-mental-models-for-web3-chris-dixon)
  - equity package: tokens (liquid) > stock options (illiquid)
  - FAANG can dedicate resources to sponsoring visas for immigrants. Crypto startups usually can't
  - > but in 2021, residence in the US is less important than ever before
