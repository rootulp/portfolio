# Reading list

Prior to 2022 I didn't maintain this page but a partial list of my favorite reads are on [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/@cp8p4T62A36aod1542g5815g8ed7AX7a7dtzW8u6aoN1ejpfR1058Rk2yemnKa3b).
If you want to talk about any of these, please reach out to me!

- https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721
  - `tokenURI` points to ERC721 Metadata JSON schema which contains properties / image
  - `setApprovalForAll()` authorizes an operator to manage all of the tokens you have from this contract
  - `approve()` authorizes the approved address to manage an individual tokenId
- https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155
  - uses `URI` instead of `tokenURI` from ERC-721
  - enables batch transfers
  - enables one contract to support multiple collections of NFTs
  - enables one contract to support NFTs and SFTs (semi-fungible tokens)
- https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981
  - adds `royaltyInfo()` function that exchanges can opt-in to using in order to determine how much of a token sale should be distributed to creator
- https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165
  - adds `supportsInterface()` function that enables a contract to determine if another contract supports a particular interface
- https://blog.opensea.io/announcements/introducing-the-collection-manager/
  - Uses ERC-1155
  - Is [this](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963#readContract) collection manager on Polygon?
- https://research.paradigm.xyz/cartoon-guide-to-perps
  - perpetual swap == perp
  - mark price: price of perp on exchange
  - index price: price of underlying asset on external exchange
  - funding fee = abs(mark price - index price). Paid between ppl who long and short
  - margin: collateral a trader puts up
- https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/05/everlasting-options
  - > A call gives the holder the right to buy a certain asset (the underlier) for a certain price (the strike), at a certain time on a certain date (the expiration).
  - A put option is the right to sell an asset for a price at a certain time
  - call payoff = max(spot - strike, 0)
  - put payoff = max(strike - spot, 0)
  - [Black-Scholes model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model) is a curve used to price a call or put prior to expiry
  - options with a expiry date which forces traders who want to maintain their position after the expiry to "roll" (aquire new options with a later expiry)
  - since options have different expiry dates, market makers have fragmented liquidity b/c they need to faciliate markets for options that expire today, tomorrow, next week, etc.
- https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/08/power-perpetuals
  - funding fee = abs(mark - index). Paid between ppl who long and short at a regular interval (ex. daily).
  - funding fee == premium yield
  - > If the price of ETH doubles, the ETH^2 power perp 4Xs
- https://opyn.gitbook.io/squeeth/resources/squeeth-faq
  - basis == funding fee == abs(mark - index)
  - funding in-kind: ppl who long Squeeth (buy oSQTH) don't have to explicitly pay funding fee to ppl who short Squeeth per interval (daily).
    Instead, the normalization factor adjusts a long Squeeth position so it loses value equal to the funding fee per interval.
    Similarly, the normalization factor adjusts a short Squeeth position so it owes less debt equal to the funding fee per interval.
  - funding fee = position size * TWAP(mark - index)
  - funding fee is paid everytime contract is touched (continuously)
- https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/09/the-community-garden-the-case-for-leaving-faang-companies-for-crypto
  - reminds me a lot of [Chrix Dixon on Bankless podcast](http://podcast.banklesshq.com/90-5-mental-models-for-web3-chris-dixon)
  - equity package: tokens (liquid) > stock options (illiquid)
  - FAANG can dedicate resources to sponsoring visas for immigrants. Crypto startups usually can't
  - > but in 2021, residence in the US is less important than ever before
- https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/01/constant-rate-issuance-sales-protocol
  - Exponential Moving Average (EMS)
  - https://github.com/FrankieIsLost/CRISP
  - What if [nouns](https://nouns.wtf/) was implemented with CRISP and a target of one sale per day? Would the nouns DAO treasury be larger or smaller than it currently is? Need [mainnet forking](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/guides/mainnet-forking.html) for real history ðŸ™ƒ.
- https://starknet.io/documentation/on-chain-data/
  - It is important to publish the state diff between the previous state and the current state to the blockchain. StarkNet publishes this data in the calldata of a transaction posted to L1.
- https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-data-availability
  - Optimistic rollups use a fraud proof (or proof of fraud) to detect invalid blocks
  - Zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups use a validity proof to prove that a block is vald
  - Both Optimistic and ZK rollups need to post data from a block to a data availability layer (commonly L1 but could also be Celestia)
  - Data availability proofs use erasure codes
  - [Erasure code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure_code) takes a message of length N and increases its length for redundancy. The goal is so that if any of the larger message gets lost in transmission, the original message N may still be recoverable.

- [NFT Drops Are Broken: Hereâ€™s How We Fix Them](https://nftnow.com/features/nft-drops-are-broken-heres-how-we-fix-them/) by NiftyTable and Takens Theorem
  - Options to mitigate gas wars caused by NFT drops:
    1. [Parallel](https://parallel.life/): reserve NFTs off-chain prior to drop. Reservees may pay for NFT during 24 hour time window.
    2. [MultiRaffle](https://github.com/Anish-Agnihotri/MultiRaffle): users purchase raffle tickets = to the amount an NFT will cost. After raffle ticket purhcase period, winning tickets are revealed using [Chainlink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf/). Winning tickets may redeem NFT. Losing tickets may be refunded.
    3. Add [CAPTCHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) style puzzles to prevent bots from having unfair advantage
    4. Prompt users with mint transactions going to mempool to use [Flashbots](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-protect/rpc/quick-start/)
  - Surprised this article didnâ€™t mention [Dutch auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_auction) or [CRISP](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/01/constant-rate-issuance-sales-protocol)
